A bright and relatively high-contrast GUI color scheme consisting of a white background and easy-to-read colors which are meant to be strong without being painfully vivid. Aside from undercurl and underline, all other attributes are removed (e.g. no bold or italic text). No language-specific highlighting is included: only the basics.
